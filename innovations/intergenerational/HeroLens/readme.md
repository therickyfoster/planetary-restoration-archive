## 1️⃣ Introduction

Welcome to **Herolens Live: The Regenerative Trust Stack** — an open-source initiative to build a radically transparent, decentralized, and regenerative platform where governance, ecological restoration, and public service converge. Our goal is to architect trust, incentivize good, and decentralize oversight in a modular and globally scalable system.

---

## 2️⃣ Vision and Purpose

Herolens Live aims to:
- 🕊️ **Restore public trust** via real-time livestream transparency.
- 🌱 **Incentivize regenerative actions** with on-chain rewards.
- ⚡ **Gamify societal contributions** ("Classcraft 2.0").
- 🔒 **Preserve immutable historical records** of service and restoration efforts.
- 🌍 **Bridge centralized and decentralized systems seamlessly** for a regenerative future.

---

## 3️⃣ System Overview

Herolens is designed as a modular, extensible stack:
- 🔴 **Livestream Trust Layer**
- 🔐 **Immutable Archive Backend**
- 💸 **Incentive Engine**
- 🎮 **Gamified Behavior Framework**
- 🗳️ **DAO Governance Layer**

Each module is interoperable and built for gradual decentralization and future-proofing.

---

## 4️⃣ Core Modules

1️⃣ **Livestream Interface:**  
Early-stage integration with Twitch/YouTube APIs; native stack built on Livepeer + Lens Protocol for Web3-native livestreaming.

2️⃣ **Immutable Archival Backend:**  
Multi-chain notarization, IPFS pinning, redundancy across jurisdictions.

3️⃣ **Incentive Engine:**  
Crypto + fiat tipping/donations, verified "proof of impact" payouts.

4️⃣ **Classcraft 2.0 Gamification:**  
Quest system, badges, achievements, peer-reviewed reputation system.

5️⃣ **DAO Governance:**  
Multi-token architecture with voting rights, referenda, treasury management.

---

Herolens is structured around interoperability and modularity:
- **API-first architecture** for extensibility.
- **Immutable record layer:** IPFS, Arweave, Filecoin.
- **Blockchain anchors:** Ethereum, Polygon.
- **Livestream infra:** Start with Twitch/YouTube, transition to Livepeer.
- **Frontend:** Mobile-first, cross-platform UI (React Native prototype).

---

## 6️⃣ Governance and DAO Structure

- **Treasury:** Controlled by token holders.
- **Voting:** On-chain proposals and voting with stake-weighted mechanisms.
- **Upgradability:** Modular governance modules for future adaptability.
- **Transparency:** Immutable logs of all governance actions.

---

## 7️⃣ Incentive Design

- Direct tipping for livestream participants (Stripe + crypto wallets).
- Community-funded quests and bounties.
- Proof-of-impact attestation and reward verification system.
- Optional reputation economy layer rewarding consistent regenerative action.

---

## 8️⃣ Inclusivity and Equity Framework

- Knowledge sovereignty and protection through open TK Labels framework.
- Revenue-sharing directly embedded into governance treasury.
- Local language, iconographic UI for accessibility.

---

## 9️⃣ Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1:** MVP with existing APIs + IPFS + Stripe/crypto tips.  
**Phase 2:** Gamification engine + reputation system prototype.  
**Phase 3:** DAO launch + native Web3 livestream infrastructure.  
**Phase 4:** Inclusive deployments and global onboarding.
